# AkiroOS 🧠💻

AkiroOS is a **text-based, terminal-style operating system simulation** written in **pure Python**.

This project is built for **learning system-level thinking**, not to act as a real operating system.  
The focus is on understanding **flow, state, structure, and control** through code.

---

## 🚀 Version

**v0.1 — Initial Public Release**

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn Python by building a single, connected system  
- Simulate OS-like flow: boot → login → desktop → apps  
- Practice state management (Wi-Fi ON / OFF)  
- Experience real project chaos and structuring  
- Build something that *feels* like an OS in the terminal

---

## ✨ Features (v0.1)

- 🔐 Admin-only login (fake authentication)
- 🖥️ Boot sequence and desktop simulation
- 📶 Wi-Fi Manager app (ON / OFF state)
- ℹ️ System Info app
- 🔁 App navigation with return-to-desktop flow
- 🧪 Fully terminal-based (no GUI)
- Use CTRL + C to stop
---

## 📂 Apps Included

### 1. Wi-Fi Manager
- Toggle Wi-Fi ON or OFF
- Simulates a system-wide state

### 2. system-info.app
- Displays OS version
- Shows developer info
- Indicates development status

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Frameworks:** None  
- **External Packages:** None  

Only core Python concepts are used:
- functions  
- conditionals  
- loops  
- state variables  
- input/output  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ❌ This is **not a real operating system**
- 🔐 Authentication is **fake by design**
- 🌐 No real networking or system control
- 🧪 Code reflects a learning stage and may be messy

Chaos is part of the process.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

Planned for future versions:
- Shutdown feature
- Additional user roles
- Cleaner control flow
- Improved state handling
- More apps (carefully scoped)

## 🧠 Final Note

This repository represents a moment in my learning journey.  
It is intentionally simple and imperfect.

> **Build first. Learn deeply. Refactor later.**
